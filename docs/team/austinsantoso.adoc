== PROJECT: MoneyGoWhere

---

== Overview

MoneyGoWhere is a desktop application which aims to help users keep track of their spending, as well as necessary information such as date, cost and name.
Users can also set a budget, set reminders as well as get stats of the spending.

MoneyGoWhere has a Command Line Interface(CLI) for user to interact with as well as a Graphical User Interface(GUI) built using JavaFx.
It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== My Role

I was tasked to implement the `Budget` feature of the program, as well as implemented the ability for users to press the up and down key to traverse their command history. I have also made notable contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows my contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the `Budget` feature of MoneyGoWhere
** What it does: Allows users to set a monthly budget.
** Justification: This feature is a core component in the program. One of the key features of the program is to show the user whether or not the user spends within budget.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth  of the software architecture. It affects other commands as it affected by certain commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented `showbudget` command to show users their budget as well as sum of spending in the month set.
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the ability for users to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
