== PROJECT: MoneyGoWhere

== Overview

MoneyGoWhere is a personal finance application targeted at students at the National University of Singapore (NUS), designed by my team and I for our Software Engineering project.

Designed primarily with a Command Line Interface (CLI), it allows students to keep track of all their spending with related information such as date, cost and tags. Users can also set budget goals, view statistics, view exchange rates, set their existing  set reminders for bills, import and export their data from and to a .csv file.

=== My Role

I was tasked to complete import and export feature, as well as to enhance the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to be more user-friendly.
I have also made notable contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

Listed below are some notations that are used throughout the document.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my contributions to the team project.

=== Major enhancement: Added the ability to import & export spending data

I have implemented both the import and export feature to make the spending data more portable for the user.

==== What it does

It allows the user to save his spending data in an external file and modifies the data before importing it back into the application.

It also allows the user to change between computers without a fear of losing his spending data.

==== Justification

This feature improves the product significantly as the user may have existing data before starting to use the application
and to export the spending data if he would like to change between multiple computers.

==== Highlights
This enhancement functions well with existing commands as it adds more spending into the list, all the other features such as budget, graph and statistics are updated as well.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

=== Minor enhancement: Redesign the user interface to be more user-friendly

I have also redesigned the entire user interface to be more user-friendly.

==== What it does

This enhancement allows the application to have a better-looking, more user-friendly colour theme
as well as allows the application window size to be resizeable.

==== Justification

As the application is targeting to solve a financial problem, I figure it would be better to have a light theme coupled with a green colour scheme as opposed to the dark theme given by the base project, AddressBook-Level3.

==== Highlights

When the application window is resized, all components in the application is resized as well according to the window size. This allows the application to still be usable even after the window size is resized.
